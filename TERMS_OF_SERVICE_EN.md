# Perverbot Terms of Service ("TOS")

Last updated: June 25, 2025

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By using Perverbot (the "Service"), you fully agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of the Service
Perverbot is a personal project with no corporate entity behind it. The bot provides game match analysis (e.g., Counter-Strike 2, League of Legends) and generates audio/video content through artificial intelligence models (including Google Gemini). Depending on the selected personality, the output language may be intentionally vulgar and profane.

## 3. Usage Requirements
1. **Minimum Age**: 13 years old (or older if required by local law).
2. **Account**: You must have a valid Discord account or another supported channel.
3. **Permissions**: You grant Perverbot the necessary permissions to read messages, download attachments, process replay files, and post responses.

## 4. User Conduct
You are prohibited from using the Service to:
- Violate any applicable laws or regulations;
- Post unlawful, defamatory, discriminatory, or hate-inciting content;
- Spam, phish, or attempt to compromise the security of the Service;
- Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software.

## 5. Generated Content
The content generated by the bot is created by AI models and may contain errors or explicit language. You agree to use such content at your own risk and not to consider it professional advice.

## 6. License Granted to User
We grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to access and use the Service and the generated content solely for non-commercial purposes, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

## 7. Intellectual Property
All rights, titles, and interests in and to Perverbot, including source code, logos, and trademarks, are owned by their respective holders. You do not acquire any ownership rights.

## 8. Feedback
Any feedback you provide can be used freely to improve the Service without any obligation for compensation.

## 9. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold the developers of Perverbot harmless from any claim or demand arising from your improper use of the Service.

## 10. Limitation of Liability
The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use or inability to use the Service.

## 11. Third-Party Services
Perverbot integrates with external services (e.g., Google Gemini, HeyGen, Riot Games API, Steam). We are not affiliated with or endorsed by these entities. Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms.

### 11.1 API Key Management
The Service uses API keys for external services to function.

*   **Google Gemini**: For text content generation, the Service uses a default API key. However, you have the option to provide your own personal API key to replace the default one.
*   **HeyGen**: The video generation features require you to provide your own personal API key. Without it, the related service will not be available.

If you provide one or more personal API keys, they will be stored locally and used only for your requests. You are solely responsible for the management and security of your own keys.

## 12. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. The changes will take effect upon publication. Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 13. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service for any violation of these Terms. You may stop using the Service at any time.
