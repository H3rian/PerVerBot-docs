## 1. About Us
Perverbot ("we," "our," or the "Service") is a bot that provides match analysis, AI-generated commentary, and other multimedia content.

## 2. Data We Collect
| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Identifiers | Discord ID, username, avatar | To identify the user and respond to requests |
| User-Submitted Content | Messages, audio files, replay files (CS2 demo, LOL replay) | To process analyses, generate commentary, and podcasts |
| API Keys (optional) | Google Gemini API Key, HeyGen API Key | To enable advanced features at the user's request |
| Generated Files | Audio/video/podcasts created by the bot | To provide the content requested by the user |

We **only** collect data that the user voluntarily decides to provide.

## 3. How We Use Data
The data provided is used exclusively to deliver the requested features. It is stored only for the time strictly necessary to complete the operation and can be removed at any time via bot commands or upon request.

## 4. Data Sharing
We share data only when strictly necessary for the service to function (e.g., sending a request to an external API like Google Gemini). We do not sell or rent user data.

## 5. Security
We take reasonable technical measures to protect the security of the provided data.

## 6. User Rights
The user has the right to request access to, correction of, and deletion of their data.

## 7. Exercising Your Rights
The user can independently manage and delete much of the data they provide (such as optional API keys) through specific bot commands. For any other request, the user is encouraged to use the direct communication channels provided by the platform on which the bot operates.

## 8. Minors
The Service is not intended for children under 13.
