# Perverbot Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 21, 2026

## 1. About Us
Perverbot ("we," "our," or the "Service") is a bot that provides match analysis, AI-generated commentary, and other multimedia content.

## 2. Data We Collect
| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Identifiers | Discord ID, username, avatar | To identify the user and respond to requests |
| Messages | Textual conversation content | To provide context for AI responses (transient only) |
| User Profiles | Game nicknames, Steam ID, Rank, Bio | To personalize analyses and responses |
| Replay Files | CS2 demo, LoL replay | Processed locally to extract match data (not shared with third parties) |
| Parsed Match Data | Kills, deaths, objectives, tactical events | To generate commentary and statistics |
| API Keys (optional) | Google Gemini API Key | To enable advanced features at the user's request |
| Generated Content | Audio/podcasts created by the bot | To provide the content requested by the user |

We **only** collect data that the user voluntarily decides to provide.

## 3. How We Use Data
The data provided is used exclusively to deliver the requested features.
- **Messages**: We do **not** store your message history in our database. We retrieve a limited number of recent messages directly from Discord via API when needed for context and process them transitorily.
- **Replay Files**: Demos and replays are processed locally on our server and are deleted shortly after data extraction.
- **Other Data**: Stored only for the time strictly necessary to complete the operation and can be removed at any time via bot commands (e.g., `/profile`) or upon request.

## 4. Data Sharing
We share specific data only when strictly necessary for the service to function:
- **AI Models**: We share textual messages (transient context), user profile data, and parsed match data with AI third-party providers
- **No Third-Party Sharing of Raw Replays**: RAW replay files (CS2 demos, LoL replays) are **never** shared with external AI providers or third parties.
- **No Sale of Data**: We do not sell or rent user data.

## 5. Security
We take reasonable technical measures to protect the security of the provided data.

## 6. User Rights
The user has the right to request access to, correction of, and deletion of their data.

## 7. Exercising Your Rights
The user can independently manage and delete much of the data they provide (such as profile data) through specific bot commands. For any other request, the user is encouraged to use the direct communication channels provided by the platform on which the bot operates.

## 8. Minors
The Service is not intended for children under 13.

## 9. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this policy. Changes will be posted in this document with a new "Last updated" date.
