## Profile Setup

### CS2 Profile
To set up your CS2 profile, you need three pieces of information:

1. **SteamID**: Copy the numbers after `profiles/` from your Steam profile URL
   - Example: `https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/123456789` â†’ Use `123456789`

2. **Steam Auth Code**: Get this from [Steam Help](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=730&issueid=128) (ACCESS MATCH HISTORY)

3. **Match Share Code**: From your CS2 match history, use only the "CSGO-" part
   - The bot can only see matches played AFTER the share code you select (not older than 30 days)
